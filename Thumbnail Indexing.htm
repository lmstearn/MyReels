<P>As the performance overheads for storing over 24000 individual 17.4k <A HREF="Quote Thumbnails.htm">Quote Thumbnails</A> were originally considered not applicable for the package, the idea was to assign an index to each thumbnail so it could point to more than one quote. Given that the <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A> are by default ordered alphabetically and not by subject, we were then presented with the task of providing a treeview styled approach to displaying how the images are assigned. For now let's just settle with the <U><A HREF="Bitmap Finder Screen.htm">Bitmap Finder Screen</A></U>.</P>

<P>On the RHS of the <U><A HREF="Configure Thumbnails Screen.htm">Configure Thumbnails Screen</A></U>, a selection of  9 quotes in the <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> from the offset seen in the scroll counter, are displayed. For the items with <A HREF="Quote Thumbnails.htm">Quote Thumbnails</A> attached, there will also be an index displayed to the left:- blue if an image is actually stored at the location, orange if it is just a ponter to the location. Orange indices have a <A HREF="Tooltip.htm">Tooltip</A> indicating the index of the quote where the actual image is held.</P>

<P>Assigning an indexed <A HREF="Quote Thumbnails.htm">Quote Thumbnail</A> to a <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quote</A> in the <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> is performed by first selecting the item in the LHS listbox, then clicking the desired RHS quote or image (with either blue or orange index) before committing the change with the Assign button.</P>

<P>The actual values of the indices simply increase each time a new picture is introduced to the <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A>, they don't bear any relation to the current LHS Listbox <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quote</A> position or scroll counter.</P>

<P>A change on the <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> made with the Assign, Append or Delete buttons will be reflected on the RHS when either the <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quote</A> precedes alphabetically, or is visible on, the items on the RHS of the screen.</P>

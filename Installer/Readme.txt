MyReels V 3.0. Windows. Freeware Slot Machine styled game with multiple paylines.
Uninstalling version 1.X OR 2.0X OR 2.1X prior to installing later version is recommended, and in any case automeated.  Profile Configurations other than the default or generic will not be changed in the uninstall, and, to preserve functionality of existing shortcuts, the MyReels base directory used in older versions is recommended for the installation of versions 2.2X or later.
First time users note that base install directory pathname should be 100 characters or less. If access to MyReels Profiles is required via the Start button, it is recommended that the MyReels Group (already chosen from the Start Menu / Programs Group as default during installation), remains selected so that new Profile Configuration shortcuts can be written there.
Version 1.X Hallfame.s$t files not compatible with versions 2X. Quotes.s$t files created by versions older than 2.2X should be replaced or deleted. Please consult Monte Carlo in help before using the Monte Carlo feature. Vb6 Runtime files included. <Shift> or Right-Click on Game Screen for menu. Problems or queries with Installing, Uninstalling, Version or Version History details, refer to the bundled help (MyReels.chm) file.

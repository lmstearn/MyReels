#### Windows: Freeware Slot Machine styled game with multiple paylines. ####
 - - - -
* VB6 program that makes for some kind of three payline game featuring an extensive range of quotes with pictures and sounds. The machine is a five-reel slot that uses photographs saved as .bmp files for game symbols. From the configuration menu, you can change the graphics of the symbols, and select different sound effects, background MIDI files, and substitution symbols that offer additional payoffs, starting bank amount, and lots more variations.

* Uninstalling version 1.X OR 2.0X OR 2.1X prior to installing later version is recommended, and in any case automated with the new installation routine.  Profile Configurations other than the default or generic will not be changed in the uninstall, and, to preserve functionality of existing shortcuts, the MyReels base directory used in older versions is recommended for the installation of versions 2.2X or later.

* First time users note that the base install directory pathname should be (still, sorry) 100 characters or less. If access to MyReels Profiles is required via the Start button, it is recommended that the MyReels Group (already chosen from the Start Menu / Programs Group as default during installation), remains selected so that new Profile Configuration shortcuts can be written there.

* Version 1.X Hallfame.s$t files not compatible with versions 2X. Quotes.s$t files created by versions older than 2.2X should be replaced or deleted. Please consult Monte Carlo in help before using the Monte Carlo feature. Vb6 Runtime files included. <Shift> or Right-Click on Game Screen for menu. Problems or queries with Installing, Uninstalling, Version or Version History details, refer to the bundled help (MyReels.chm) file.

<P>During a <A HREF="Free Game.htm">Free Game</A> or <A HREF="Free Spin.htm">Free Spin</A> <A HREF="Feature.htm">Feature,</A> the situation might arise when we <A HREF="Spin.htm">Spin</A> up a new <A HREF="Free Game.htm">Free Game</A> or <A HREF="Free Spin.htm">Free Spin</A> combination. The decision to commence the new <A HREF="Feature.htm">Feature</A> or continue the old one is made via the <U><A HREF="Free Games.htm">Free Games</A></U> or <U><A HREF="Free Spins (2).htm">Free Spins (2)</A></U> Tabs in the <A HREF="Picture Properties.htm">Picture Properties</A> Screen.</P>
<P>If we wish to continue play of the old <A HREF="Feature.htm">Feature</A> then a decision has to be made as to whether the new <A HREF="Feature.htm">Feature</A> should be Stored for playback later. If there is more than one such emergent <A HREF="Feature.htm">Feature</A>, how many can be Stored? The maximum, or cap for each <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> under consideration is 10 per <A HREF="Payline.htm">Payline</A> and the default setting is 5.  Newly Stored <A HREF="Feature.htm">Features</A> always appear last in the "queue" and any surplus to the cap are ignored.</P>

<P>In a <A HREF="Multiline.htm">Multiline</A> game, the middle <A HREF="Payline.htm">Payline</A> is always considered first, the bottom <A HREF="Payline.htm">Payline</A>, when active, is always considered last. No further combinatons in the same <A HREF="Spin.htm">Spin</A> are Stored after a <A HREF="Feature-Reset.htm">Feature-Reset</A> has been detected. <A HREF="Scatter.htm">Scatter</A> <A HREF="Feature.htm">Features</A> are treated as middle <A HREF="Payline.htm">Payline</A> combinations.</P>

<P>When a feature is Stored, the exact positions of the <A HREF="Reels.htm">Reels</A> that hold the <A HREF="Picture.htm">Pictures</A> with the <A HREF="Feature.htm">Feature</A> are queued, to be called upon at  cessation of the previous plays. Queue position is, of course, determined by the settings explained in <A HREF="Free Game &amp; Free Spin Contentions.htm">Free Game &amp; Free Spin Contentions</A>.</P>

<P>Messages in the <A HREF="Game Messages Area.htm">Game Messages Area</A> on the <A HREF="Game Screen.htm">Game Screen </A>provide relevant information pertaining to the above but there is no visual status on current queue sizes in this <A HREF="Version.htm">Version</A>.</P>

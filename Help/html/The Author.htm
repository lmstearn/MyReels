<P>A Slot machine game was not ... the most original choice, but the waiting for a decent, nag - free game got me down so, more than umpteen years later here we are ... phew ...(<A HREF="Version.htm">Version</A> 3.x) ...  (+ a similar resonation from the <A HREF="DisAssociates.htm">DisAssociates</A>). Was it worth the wait? I hope you will reply in the affirmative. A special thanks to all <A HREF="Credits.htm">those</A> who contributed snippets and advice so that games like <I>all your own</I> are made possible (or impossible!).</P>

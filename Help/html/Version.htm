<P>The current Version of this game is 3.3.1. A large number of bugs have been fixed from 1.0, along with <A HREF="Installation.htm">Installation</A> issues addressed, some <A HREF="Future Improvements.htm">Future Improvements</A>, an <A HREF="Updater.htm">Updater</A>, and an improved help file. Ongoing version development is described in the <A HREF="Version History.htm">Version History</A>, <A HREF="More Version History.htm">More Version History</A> and <A HREF="Even More Version History.htm">Even More Version History</A>, and pre-release news of exciting new Versions will appear on <A HREF="The Author.htm">The Author's</A> <A class="externLink" HREF="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~lmstearn/index.html#MyReels">Homepage</A>.</P>

<dt><U>Notes for MyReels Versions 1.X &amp; 2.X</U>:</dt>
<dd>Version 2.X is compatible with Version 1.X <I>Slotdata.s$t</I> files but not 1.X <I>Hallfame.s$t</I> files. 1.X <I>Hallfame.s$t</I> files are unusable and should be discarded (but past glories not forgotten).</dd>
<dd>The first releases of MyReels were made with the VB5 compiler, versions 2.2X and later are VB6, and as before, run on any machine where Win32 is defined.</dd>
<dd>The Database DLL this program initially used was <I>DAO350.DLL</I>. There are newer versions available in the form <I>DA03**.DLL</I>, and there presence in the system directory shouldn't adversely affect the <A HREF="Installation.htm">Installation</A> or performance of this program.</dd>
<dd>Msflxgrd.ocx was only bundled with versions up to 2.1X. <I>Favrites.txt</I> for the <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A> was also removed, but a text file can be easily generated from the <U><A HREF="Configure Thumbnails Screen.htm">Configure Thumbnails Screen</A></U>.</dd>

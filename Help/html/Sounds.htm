 <P>Configuration dialogs on the <A HREF="Sounds &amp; Music.htm">Sounds &amp; Music</A> of MyReels:</P>
<ul>
<li>At top left a check to enable Sounds</li>
<li>At top left  a check to enable sounds for the <A HREF="Quote Thumbnails.htm">Quote Thumbnails</A>. It's not available when using <A HREF="Big Pictures.htm">Big Pictures</A>.</li>
<li>A section for wave files with a list of event descriptions and a corresponding list of wave file names. Wave files are first selected from the RH list of wave file names, and can then be either <A HREF="File Dialog.htm">chosen with the "Browse" button</A> (100 characters or less required for the directory pathname and filename), or from the list of System Sounds below. Once selceted, they will appear in the text box to the left of the "Test" button at top. On being satisfied the selected Sound fits the event description, only the "Add" button will commit the new change. The selected Sound can also be removed with the "Clear" button.</li>
<li>A check to display only currently assigned System Sounds.</li>
<li>The <A HREF="Midi.htm">Midi</A> files section also contains a list of event descriptions and a corresponding list of <A HREF="Midi.htm">Midi</A> file names. If the "Randomise" is unchecked, the background files will be played in the listed order in a cyclic fashion. If "Randomise" is checked, a new random selection is generated when a <A HREF="Spin.htm">Spin</A> is initiated through the <U><A HREF="Game Screen.htm">Game Screen</A></U>. If the game is left idle, however, the playlist order reverts to cyclic, regardless of this setting. <A HREF="Midi.htm">Midi</A> file names <A HREF="File Dialog.htm">selected with the "Browse" button</A> are required to be less than 101 characters in length.</li>
<li>A list displaying enumerated <A HREF="Midi.htm">Midi</A> devices. Prior to XP, the selection of 0 prevented MyReels from using <A HREF="Midi.htm">Midi</A> altogether, where it could only be re-enabled here, not from the <U><A HREF="Game Screen.htm">Game Screen</A></U>. In newer versions of Windows it is equivalent to turning the music off.</li>

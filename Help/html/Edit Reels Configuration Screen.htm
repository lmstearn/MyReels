<H4><A NAME="Edit Reels Configuration Screen"></A>The Edit Reels Configuration Screen features:</H4>

<ul>
<li>At top, a button labelled "Regenerate All". This will generate a fairly random set of numbers, replacing the entire range shown on Screen, ordering them according to <A HREF="Rank.htm">Rank</A> as designated in the checkbox  below. It will also reset any <A HREF="Scatter.htm">Scatter</A> allocations.</li>
<li>A check for the displayed numbers to be arranged in ascending order, the smallest corresponding to the <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> of highest <A HREF="Rank.htm">Rank</A>.</li>
<li><A HREF="Picture.htm">Pictures</A>, when clicked will be, under specific conditions, selected as <A HREF="Scatter.htm">Scatters</A>.</li>
<li href="#" id="Picture Numbers">Associated  with each <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> is a row of 5 numbers, corresponding to the 5 <A HREF="Reels.htm">Reels</A>. Each number represents the numerical occurrence of the <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> on the specified Reel. Each of the 2 sets of 5 columns of numbers (the RH columns refer to the second set of 7 <A HREF="Picture.htm">Pictures</A>) must add to 24, or <A HREF="Reels.htm">Reels</A> generation will not occur. Right clicking a number will decrement its value by one, left clicking will increment its value by one. Restrictions apply if the "Ordered" option is chosen. Up to four of these numbers can be zero, thus excluding a <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> from a Reel altogether. Any arrangement with at least one excluded <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> is termed an <A HREF="Ordinatio Partialis.htm">Ordinatio Partialis</A>.</li>
<li>Buttons with "Reel" labels that perform the same function as "Regenerate All," except the generation only applies to their corresponding column of numbers. They are not available if at least one of the <A HREF="Picture.htm">Pictures</A> is a <A HREF="Scatter.htm">Scatter</A>.</li>
<li>A "Generate" button at centre top quits to the <U><A HREF="Profile Configuration Manager Screen.htm">Profile Configuration Manager Screen</A></U> and commits the current <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> allocations to a new random arrangement on the <A HREF="Reels.htm">Reels</A>. All <A HREF="Substituter.htm">Substituters</A>, <A HREF="Free Game.htm">Free Games</A> and <A HREF="Free Spin.htm">Free Spins</A> are nullified or reset when this occurs.</li>
<li>Activating the "Cancel" button will discard any changes made on this screen and quits to the <U><A HREF="Profile Configuration Manager Screen.htm">Profile Configuration Manager Screen</A></U>.</li>

<dd>The installer for <A HREF="Version.htm">Version</A> 3.X is recommended. To check for updates to the program use the <A HREF="Updater.htm">Updater</A>.</dd>
<dd>If intending to upgrade to 3.X, uninstalling older versions of MyReels will not remove custom <A HREF="Profile Configuration.htm">Profile Configurations</A> created post installation as those can still be used for the new <A HREF="Version.htm">Version</A>.</dd>
<dd>Running an installer newer than 3.0 with MyReels already installed invokes a repair dialog. The behaviour of Repair is as if the game was installed for the first time.</dd>
<dd>The newer version of <A HREF="Active Candy.htm">Active Candy</A> buttons in  MyReels will malfunction if OLE automation is absent, obsolete or incorrectly installed. Please contact <A HREF="The Author.htm">The Author</A> if this scenario is suspect.</dd>
<dd>The installation for <A HREF="Version.htm">Version</A> 3.X is per-user, but the MyReels System Files install is not, so it is considered as a separate, albeit child install. Multi-user systems can resource a shared game installation directory, but it is not recommended without <a href="Installation.htm#Uninstallation">Uninstallation</a> considerations.</dd>
<dt>Uninstallation</dt>
<dd>Locate the MyReels entry in Apps &amp; Features or Programs &amp; Features (used to be double-clicking the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel and click Add/Remove). This is preferred to executing <I>unins000.exe</I> or <I>unins001.exe</I> from the base directory as certain uninstall scripts do not run.</dd>
<dd>For complete removal of <A HREF="Version.htm">Versions</A> older than 3.X, any other <A HREF="Profile Configuration.htm">Profile Configurations</A> that you have created that exist entirely in directories you have nominated, will have to be deleted manually; and their associated <A HREF="Shortcut.htm">Shortcuts</A> will need to be deleted from the Programs group in the Start Menu. In <A HREF="Version.htm">Version</A> 3X <a class="externLink" href="https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/1193043/Inno-Setup-Cleanup-Extra-Files">greater flexibility</a> is introduced when prompted for the deletion of extra files in specific locations.</dd>
<dd>If MyReels <A HREF="Version.htm">Versions</A> prior to 2.20 are not uninstalled prior to install of 2.2X as per recommendation, users will be left with a redundant, (as far as MyReels is concerned) registered ACTCNDY4.ocx in any &amp;winsys&amp; ( Windows System or System32 directory). If such a file exists on your machine (even If such an old version of MyReels were installed on any system later than Win2k) please refer to <A HREF="ActiveX Maintenance.htm">ActiveX Maintenance</A>.</dd>
<dd>It is recommended to uninstall MyReels system files when prompted during the uninstall.</dd>
<dd href="#" id="Uninstallation">When uninstalling MyReels from a shared directory on a multi-user system, it is not recommended to delete any extra directories not created by you, when prompted, without prior consent from the other users.</dd>
<dd>As MyReels 2.2X and later uses VB6 runtimes, uninstalling prior <A HREF="Version.htm">Versions</A> is recommended (particularly on older machines: see <a href="Installation.htm#Note">Note</a> below) in removing older installed components like VB5 runtimes &amp; MSflexgrd.ocx.</dd>
</dl>

<P>If there are issues with getting the game to work consider the following in a bug report:</P>
<ul>
<li>Windows Version</li>
<li>User Access: NT Logon rights or UAC issues.</li>
<li>Is the install directory pathname 100 characters or less?</li>
<li>Was there any unusual system activity during or after the install?</li>
<li>Did the install procedure work correctly and the Finish button clicked?</li>
<li>Were other programs running while starting MyReels?</li>
<li>Was the game launched from the Start menu?</li>
<li>Did the Splash or Intro Screen or the <U><A HREF="Game Screen.htm">Game Screen</A></U> ever show?</li>
<li>The kind of error generated and any information provided with error message numbers.</li>
<li><B>Old Installer</B>: Possibility of a corrupted(?) later version of one of the packaged System install files. To check, use a Text Editor to view the  install.log file located in the directory where the game is installed, the MyReels base directory, verifying if any files were not copied to your &amp;winsys&amp; directory due to a (previous) "version" condition.</li>
<li>Last Resort: Uninstall MyReels, restart Windows and install again by running MyReels.exe and following the install instructions etc..</li>
</ul>

<h1 href="#" id="Note" style="display:inline;">Note for Windows versions prior to </h1> <h2 style="display:inline;">XP</h2> <h1 style="display:inline;">:</h1>
<P>The installer for <A HREF="Version.htm">Versions</A>3.X contains functions that will fail. The best bet is to download and extract the archive from the relevant section in the <A class="externLink" HREF="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~lmstearn/index.html#MyReels">Homepage</A>. MyReels will not run on any earlier platform than Windows 95 and in any case Win 95 users won't be able to view this help without <A class="externLink" HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=31661">DCOM95</A> installed.</P>

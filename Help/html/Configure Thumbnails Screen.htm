<H4><A NAME="Configure Thumbnails Screen"></A>The Configure Thumbnails Screen features:</H4>

<ul>
<li>On the left, a drive list, directory list, file list and a <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> file filter. A double click is required to change directories, a single left click is required to select drives and files. A beep occurs if the files are not of recognized format.</li>
<li>The central area displays image files selected in the file list. Moving over the displayed image with the right mouse button down, and then releasing it, will create a <A HREF="Cropping.htm">Cropping</A> region. Dragging and dropping the display over to the box above the Assign button, with the left mouse button will copy and size the image or its cropped region for use as one of many <A HREF="Quote Thumbnails.htm">Quote Thumbnails</A>. These images are then assigned to a selected quote only when the Assign button is clicked.</li>
<li>At the bottom left is a listbox containing the entire collection of <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A>. These can be edited by selection and keying in the change in the input section at the top of the box.</li>
<li>An Assign button. Edit changes at the top of the listbox are lost if the Assign button is not activated before selecting another item in the listbox.</li>
<li>An Append button. When clicked a new quote "New" is created and inserted alphabetically in the list of <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A>.</li>
<li>A Delete button that can remove the selected quote and its associated image from the collection.</li>
<li>To the right of  these is a scroll bar that determines the scroll offset of the quotes on the RHS of the screen. This value is displayed in the scroll counter, situated above the Assign button. Dragging the scroll slider changes the scroll counter faster. The purpose of the RHS screen is discussed in <A HREF="Thumbnail Indexing.htm">Thumbnail Indexing</A>. If the <A HREF="Generic.htm">Generic</A> <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A> <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> is loaded, left-click on any blue or orange values or indices to hear their sounds, or right-click to invoke the <U><A HREF="Bitmap Finder Screen.htm">Bitmap Finder Screen</A></U>.</li>
<li>A compact button on the bottom can be used for maintenance on the <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A>.</li>
<li>Selecting the square crops checkbox forces all rectangular <A HREF="Cropping.htm">Cropping</A> regions to snap to square when the right mouse button is released.</li>
<li>When the "Write to Text" checkbox at the bottom left of the screen is ticked, there is a prompt for the text version of the <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A> <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> to be written to a text file upon Quitting the screen.</li>
<li>Activating the Quit on the bottom left quits the screen.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><U>Notes</U>:</dt>
<dd>All images going in or out of the <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> are written to temp disk files, so depending on number of open explorer windows and/or disk access speeds, a screen refresh/change might be take a few extra milliseconds. On older rigs <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A> <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> modifications are significantly longer.</dd>
<dd>The Assign &amp; Delete buttons have no corresponding undo, and modifications with them cannot be undone even by clicking "Cancel" back on the <U><A HREF="Profile Configuration Manager Screen.htm">Profile Configuration Manager Screen</A></U>.</dd>
<dd>The <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A> <A HREF="Database.htm">Database</A> does not accept duplicate records.</dd>
<dd>If an item in the listbox has a Thumbnail assigned to it, then Deleting it or Assigning another thumbnail to it will produce a warning in the case other items have been <A HREF="Thumbnail Indexing.htm">indexed to the original Thumbnail</A>.</dd>

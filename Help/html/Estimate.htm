<P>Previously it was indicated that 10 million <A HREF="Monte Carlo.htm">Monte Carlo</A> iterations would take more than 30 hours to do on a typical Win98 machine. Then came an 350Mhz Aptiva where it took almost a minute to perform 150000 iterations on maximum configuration. In 2017, a venerable AMD FX(tm)-6200 takes around 10 seconds to perform 500,000 iterations. On older machines it would take more than 5 hours for 50 million iterations, now less than 5 minutes!</P>

<h1 style="display:inline;">Note for Version 2.11</h1> <h2 style="display:inline;">( ~1999)</h2>

<P>As much of the numeric work runs through 32 bit "native" Long operations, and the compiled, recently improved code being optimised for speed, it appears now to run around 10 times as fast than from the compiler and 3 times faster than <A HREF="Version.htm">Versions</A> prior to 2.1.1. A 30 fold improvement. (oops)</P>

<H4><A NAME="Configure New Pictures Screen"></A>The Configure New Pictures Screen features:</H4>

<ul>
<li>On the top left, a drive list, directory list, file list and a <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> file filter. A double click is required to change directories, a single left click is required to select drives and files. A beep occurs if the files are not of recognized format.</li>
<li>The central area displays image files selected in the file list. Moving over the displayed image with the right mouse button down, and then releasing it, will create a <A HREF="Cropping.htm">Cropping</A> region. Dragging and dropping the display over to one of the boxes on the right hand side of the Screen with the left mouse button will copy and size the image (or its cropped region) for use in the game.</li>
<li>On the RHS of the screen are boxes reserved for images just selected representing the new <A HREF="Picture.htm">Pictures</A>. Allocated images will be ordered in <A HREF="Rank.htm">Rank</A>. Images in the boxes can be replaced by other images and an image allocation can be cancelled altogether by clicking in the box.</li>
<li>On the bottom area is the "Open &amp; Create a new Save Directory". Activating this will provide the home for the new <A HREF="Profile Configuration.htm">Profile Configuration</A>, a location which should be set before clicking the "Allocate ..." button below. After clicking the button, the Player must choose a working directory (typically the MyReels Base Directory) where new subdirectories can be created if desired. This button and the one below it have <A HREF="Tooltip.htm">Tooltips</A> regarding <A HREF="Filesizes.htm">Filesizes</A> and available diskspace. <U>Note</U>: In this <A HREF="Version.htm">Version</A>, directory names exceeding 100 characters aren't allowed.</li>
<li>Activating the "Allocate ..." button commits the new images, deletes old files used by the game ("nn.bmp"), if they exist, and copies the currently used <I>Slotdata.s$t</I> and ("nn.bmp") all to the new home directory.</li>
<li>A "Next" button when clicked copies the <A HREF="Quotes.htm">Quotes</A> settings to the new directory and proceeds to the <U><A HREF="Edit Reels Configuration Screen.htm">Edit Reels Configuration Screen</A></U>.</li>
<li>A checkbox labelled "Square crops". Toggled on forces all rectangular <A HREF="Cropping.htm">Cropping</A> regions to snap to square when the right mouse button is released.</li>
<li>A check for the creation of a <A HREF="Shortcut.htm">Shortcut</A> when the Next button is clicked.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Notes on the "Next" Button:</dt>
<dd>As <I>Slotdata.s$t</I> is updated with new <A HREF="Picture.htm">Picture</A> data only when the "Next" button is clicked, just the last of the directories you have created or allocated on this screen will contain the new <A HREF="Profile Configuration.htm">Profile Configuration</A> data that is stored in <I>Slotdata.s$t</I>. <U>Note</U>: A particular combination of actions on this screen can lead to an <A HREF="issues.htm#Missing Bitmap Error">issue</A> on a subsequent game load- also see <A HREF="OpenError.htm">OpenError</A>.</dd>
<dd>A <A HREF="New Game.htm">New Game</A> commences each time a new <A HREF="Profile Configuration.htm">Profile Configuration</A> is created. Current data is also automatically saved when a new directory is either accessed or created.</dd>
